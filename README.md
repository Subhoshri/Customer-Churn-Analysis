# Introduction
Customer Churn Analysis is a Machine Learning project to analyze the rate of customer churn for a telephone company. Different Preprocessing steps have been included to train our model better. 

## DataSet

The dataset used covers details of customers like demographics and other details like Internet Service Providers, Tenure, Method of Billings and Subscriptions.

## Steps for Analysis

### Grouping by Tenure
   - Grouping customers based on their tenures and training our model based on that data.

### Setting Base Learners
   - Implementing base learners and bagging boosting and stacking methods to enable the model to train and predict churn rate more accurately.

## Results

The machine learning model reveals the accuracy, precision of our model in determining the churn rate. This model will enable companies to identify which customers have a higher tendency to churn and thus provide better offers and subscriptions to them.

Refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository for the model.
